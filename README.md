# To do list

## Mini project

I made this project in order to improve in javascript and practice the HTML and CSS as well.
I created a **To do list** that it has as functionalities:
* Add an element with a check box in front of it.
* When the **checkbox** is cliked the item will get a *line-troug*.
* There is also a remove button in case you don't want to do the task anymore or if you added sometting by mistake(or writted it wrong).
* At te bottom there is a **Remove All** button if you want to clerar everything up.
* the last one but nut least there is a *localStorage* funtion so the browser can remember your list, this way you can close the window and come back whenever you want.

**P.S.** when I was done I asked **chatGPT** to rearange my code so it will be easier to read and to add comments as well.
